rust tutorial for beginners 

![Welcome :3](additional-pictures-to-github/ferivon%20welcome.png)

## Getting Started:
1. Install a code editor of your choice. I personally recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
2. Install Rust on your computer by downloading it from the official Rust website or using a Rust playground available online.
3. When you need help to understand that github repo, you can connect with me on `discord` my nickname is `ferivonus#3001`

## Personal advices:
- Avoid using ChatGPT or any AI while learning Rust. It causes numerous frustrating errors that are challenging to handle. Instead, focus on writing your code by yourself. If you feel exhausted from writing, you can consult ChatGPT to assist you with the specific parts of the code you already understand.

## Using this Tutorial:
1. create a project to your computer with cargo `new [projectName]`
2. Open the main.rs file located in your project directory.
3. Copy the code snippets provided in this tutorial and paste them into the main.rs file.
4. Open the Cargo.toml file in your project directory and add the necessary dependencies or libraries as specified in the tutorial. This file helps identify the libraries that will be used in your project.
5. Build your Rust code by running the command `cargo build` in your terminal. This command compiles your code and resolves any dependencies.
6. Run your Rust code by executing the command `cargo run` in your terminal. This command compiles and runs your code in a single step.
7. If you get weird code bugs, just try `cargo clean` `cargo build` `cargo run` one more time. Sometimes it solves the problem.
8. Take the time to understand what is happening in the code by reading the comments and studying the Rust syntax. Experiment with the code and make changes to see the effects.

## Additional Tips and Resources:
- Practice regularly: Learning Rust, like any programming language, requires practice. Try to write code regularly to reinforce your understanding and improve your skills.

- Explore the Rust documentation: Rust has excellent documentation available online. Visit the official Rust website and explore the Rust book, which provides comprehensive explanations, examples, and exercises to help you learn the language.

- Join the Rust community: Engage with the vibrant Rust community to connect with other Rust developers, ask questions, and learn from experienced programmers. The Rust subreddit, Rust forums, and Discord channels are great places to start.

- Read Rust-related books and articles: There are several books and articles available that dive deeper into specific topics or provide practical examples. Explore resources like "The Rust Programming Language" (commonly known as the Rust Book), "Rust by Example," and various Rust blogs and articles.

- Contribute to open-source projects: Rust has a thriving open-source ecosystem. Consider contributing to open-source projects written in Rust to gain practical experience and collaborate with other developers.

- Attend Rust conferences and meetups: Rust conferences and meetups provide valuable opportunities to network with Rust enthusiasts, attend talks, and participate in workshops. Keep an eye out for Rust events happening locally or online.

- Take advantage of Rust tools and libraries: Rust has a growing ecosystem of tools and libraries that can make your development process easier and more efficient. Explore popular libraries like serde for serialization, actix-web for building web applications, and tokio for asynchronous programming.
### test your project with 
`cargo test`
### build documentation for your project with 
`cargo doc`
